                <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                <p>At Droll Agents, we believe in the transformative potential of artificial intelligence to improve lives and enhance human capabilities. However, we recognize that this potential must be realized responsibly, with careful consideration of the ethical implications of our technology.</p>
                <p>This Ethics Charter outlines our commitment to developing and deploying AI systems that align with our core values and respect fundamental human rights. It serves as a framework to guide our decisions and actions as we create AI agents that are beneficial, fair, transparent, and safe.</p>
                <p>We understand that ethical AI development is an ongoing journey rather than a destination. As technology evolves and our understanding deepens, we commit to regularly reviewing and refining this charter to reflect emerging ethical considerations.</p>

                <h2>2. Core Ethical Principles</h2>
                <p>Our approach to AI ethics is grounded in the following core principles:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Human-Centered Design:</strong> We develop AI to augment human capabilities and improve well-being, not to replace human judgment or autonomy.</li>
                  <li><strong>Beneficence:</strong> Our AI systems are designed to create positive impact and benefit society.</li>
                  <li><strong>Non-maleficence:</strong> We strive to prevent and minimize harm in all aspects of our AI development and deployment.</li>
                  <li><strong>Justice:</strong> We work to ensure that the benefits of AI are broadly accessible and that impacts are equitably distributed.</li>
                  <li><strong>Autonomy:</strong> We respect individuals' ability to make informed choices about their interaction with AI systems.</li>
                  <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> We commit to being open about how our AI works and the limitations of our technology.</li>
                </ul>
